Project definition
==================

The aim of the project is to make an AI that can play a simple variation of the game tic-tac-toe (called sliding tic-tac-toe) against a human opponent and against itself.
It should not spend more than maybe one second to think it's next move. It should be possible to generalize the game into 3 dimensions or at least into a board of size n*n where n is an odd integer.

## Algorithms and data structures

The AI uses min-max-algorithm and possibly monte carlo to decide the next move. There has been no previous AI implementation for this game, so it is hard to say in advance what kinds of algorithms need to be used.
