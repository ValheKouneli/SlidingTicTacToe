Progress Report: Week 2
=======================

## Overview

I have spent all my time in making and trying to make a running application that let's a human user play the game using command line interface.
In the end of the week, I have an almost-working application. In between, I have had a working application (that does not check for bad input) that was not suitable for efficient AI building or easy GUI making.
I need to make a few tests to find the current bug. At the moment game does not seem to accept any move.
My CLI doesn't check for all kinds of bad input yet.
What I plan to do next is to make a final decision on the application design and then just make the game run bug-free.

Time spent: 40h

## What I have learned and found hard

I have learned a lot about Java programming, object oriented programming and class structure design etc.
I have learned about using git and also about good git usage habits.
I have also learned that different people have very different opinions about how to implement something.
I have learned that the language you use matters a **lot** when deciding how to implement something.
I have learned that there is a lot of sense in the Minimum Viable Product method of building stuff. I have not used it.
I have learned that it's maybe better to design an application top-down (as well as bottom-up), so you build lower classes in a way that makes them handy for upper classes to use.

I have found it hard to decide an action plan and stick to it when there are so many opinions coming from all directions about how I should do thing.
I have found it hard that it is not very clear what the goal of the course project is and what are the weekly goals.
I have found it hard that I don't know much about the inner workings of Java to decide what kind of implementation makes sense in terms of effectiveness of the application's performance.

Total time spent: 40 h

## Daily reports

MON: Refreshing Java skills etc.

Time spent: 2h

MON: Starting to make core functionality of the game.

Time spent: 6h

TUE: Starting over. Planning the class structure. Refreshing Java skills. Started making tests for the new version's classes.

Time spent: 7h

TUE: Making a ton of tests and fixing bugs with their help. Fixing bugs in test.

Time spent: 2h

WED: Redesigning the class structure, again, but this time not as much as yesterday. Updated tests. Simplified the code a bit.

Time spent: 2,5h

WED: More re-ordering the class structure. Trying to make the game run. Hitting head on a wall. Buggy code is buggy.

Time spent: 4h

THO: Made the game run. Lot of refactoring. Still a lot of time goes to learning the ways of Java.

Time spent: 4h

THO: Separated game interface from game logic. Started learning Java 2D graphics and building a GUI.

Time spent: 4h

THO: Figuring out how to implement the GUI. Minor changes to things to make GUI easier to implement.

Time spent: 1,5h

FRI: Changed GUI from using java.awt to javafx. But then ended up doing the whole application from a scatch all over again... Then made the game run again using CLI. Fixed some tests. Made couple of javadocs.

Time spend: 7h
