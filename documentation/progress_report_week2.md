Progress Report: Week 2
=======================

## Overview

I have spent all my time in making a running application that let's a human user play the game using command line interface.
My CLI doesn't check for all kinds of bad input yet. I have learned a lot about Java programming, object oriented programming and class structure design etc.

Total time spent: 40 h
