Progress Report: Week 1
=======================

I set up the project. I created a repository in github and cloned it to my computer. I made a project with NetBeans+Gradle in the repository and configured Gradle to run my project. I made a main class to be able to test running the project and a dummy test to test Travis/Codecov. I made Travis and Codecov to follow my project on GitHub.

I found the set-up process frustrating. I refreshed my git skills and learned a bit about what can and can not be done automatically with NetBeans+Gradle.

Time spent: 2,5 h
